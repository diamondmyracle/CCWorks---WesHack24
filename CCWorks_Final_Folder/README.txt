Hi!

When going through our website, since we weren't able to implement everything fully, we just implemented one (mostly-done) path to show you all!

If you navigate from the Home to any of the different art types in the navbar you'll find a home page for all of them with some sections we'll be adding in the future, 
but only Film has pages for the genres within it, and of those genres, there's only a page within an existing element in the SciFi/Fantasy section (which you can access
by clicking on the "See More >" next to the genre title of the Film Home Page 

Within the SciFi/Fantasy Home page, we were only able to upload one example of how the films would appear on the home pages, and if you click on the image of the element you'll
be taken to a mock-up of how a film page would look like. 
We made the mock-up with Ghostbusters (not a student film obviously) but in the future, this would be a student film mockup

So, basically
  CCWorks Home > Film > SciFi/Fantasy > Ghostbusters


In the future, we hope to have a lot more entries and a fully-functioning sign-up/log-in and then profile section, and within that profile section there will be an upload button 
which the users will use to make entries
